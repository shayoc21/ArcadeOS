simple 16 bit real mode operating system written entirely in x86 nasm.

Based vaguely on DOS, with a custom interrupt 21.

Not perfect right now but can be said to be "finished".. feel free to write your own programs for it.

Was working on a small pong game to demo the operating system, but I lost interest, I'm moving on to a protected mode operating system now. I might finish pong and a few other games in my free time over the next few years.

Note: the repository is missing about 10 early commits due to an error I had with git.
