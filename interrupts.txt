My operating system is modelled after DOS, and so I will use a similar interrupt scheme.
Many of these interrupts will be wrappers for simple BIOS interrupts, like int 10h or 16h, others will be more comprehensive, like int 21h,10h will load an entire program into memory.

Interrupts:

	int 20h:	Soft restarts the operating system, returns to "main menu".
	int 21h:
			ah = 0x00: 	Prints a string pointed to by si.
			ah = 0x01:	Prints a single character stored in al
			ah = 0x02:	Reads a character from keyboard -- Blocking
					Returns scancode in ah, ascii in al
			ah = 0x03:	Polls keyboard -- Non-Blocking
					Returns scancode in ah, ascii in al
					ZF = 0 if a key pressed
			ah = 0x10:	Loads a program, filename pointed to by si
