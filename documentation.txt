bootloader is loaded into 0x07C0:0x0000
the bootloader then loads the:
	fat root directory into 0x07C0:0x0200
	file allocation table/s into 0x09A0:0x0600 - tried 0x0000 but this caused bugs when loading clusters..
	kernel into 0x0050:0x0000

Programs will be given the entirety of memory above 0x1000:0x0000 (960KB), the stack for programs grows from 0x0000:0x7C00, just below the bootloader
